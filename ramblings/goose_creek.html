            <p><i>Goose Creek</i></p>

            <p>We were 16 when we first found Goose Creek. It wasn’t marked on a map or officially recognized. It wasn’t even colloquially known as Goose Creek. That’s just what we called it, Ella and me. While you’re young enough, you’re supposed to disregard rules. You name things exactly as you please. How else will people know a place is really yours unless they don’t recognize the name of the place at all?</p>
            <p>Goose Creek was the perfect spot for cooling off chest-deep on those Virginia summer days when the air felt like an alcoholic’s morning breath. It was a short gravelly drive and a long walk through tall grass to get there, and you were bound to get ticks on the way. Plucking them off your crotch was just part of the ritual. Goose Creek was tucked in the back corner of an abandoned country club. The backdrop of the golf course’s overgrown golden hills resembled purgatory in both form and spirit.</p>
            <p>Ella and I grew up in the same town. Not quite an easy walking distance from each other’s homes, but bike-able. We spent summers going to the local pool and had overlapping friend groups. Externally, she seemed remarkably ordinary, and so did I. There’s not much to be said of either of us except that we were both about as average as you could get for kids growing up in an exurb. She had a small nose and large eyes, complementing each other such that her eyes made her nose look smaller and her nose made her eyes appear larger. If a Margaret Keane painting came alive, it would be Ella. Something so ordinary can still leave an indescribable impression.</p>
            <p>The local kids trickled into the pool as it opened at 9AM – we were still young enough to have no problem waking up so early – and flocked to our usual division of activities. There were loungers, who gathered on the pool deck and sprawled on towels like iguanas awaiting the sun. There were swimmers, who jolted themselves awake by jumping straight into the frigid water. I used to speculate about the meaning prescribed to each group but found there wasn’t any. The groups mixed and overlapped like the reflective shades of blue and silver from gas on a street puddle. Kids just did whatever they felt like doing that day.</p>
            <p>That morning, Ella and I both swam. We first met because of the shared craving of salt and vinegar chips in a sub. So, we left with a small group of people to get lunch. We ate and talked over cold cut sandwiches about whatever it is that people talk about when there’s nothing to talk about. I can’t remember what was said because it was unimportant. As I said, we were both incredibly plain. Plain people meet under plain circumstances. There was simply a sequence of events that carried us downstream.</p>
            <p>After downing our sandwiches with post-swim-hunger, we searched for something new. Ella and I walked and walked, prodding around for some new hangout spot. In the Piedmont region of Virginia where we were, there were plenty of places to explore. Piedmont translates to “foot of the mountain”, where the land is fertile and ancient. The terrain was diverse enough to house small mountains, forests, valleys, farmlands, rivers, and swimming holes, yet remained easily traversable. Time passed. We didn’t talk much, finding more comfort in letting our eyes wander around the landscape, searching for something that would be worthy of exploring. So, late into the afternoon and miles out of town, we wandered.</p>
            <p>Between the tree branches I saw a large web filled with dozens of caterpillars. With every step we took closer, they jumped in unison with our footsteps. I couldn’t tell if they were startled or greeting us. I waved at them in case it was the latter. Ella looked at me.</p><p>“Who are you waving at?”</p><p>“The caterpillars,” I replied, “they’re dancing with us.”</p>
            <p>She waved at them, too.</p>
            <p>The convenient thing about Virginia is that there are long and continuous railroads that traverse up and down the state. Long after we had lost the road, we continued along the tracks. It was impossible for us to get lost this way. We listened for the sounds of water and felt for excess moisture seeping through the soil onto the soles of our feet- anything which might indicate a place to swim. This land was all we knew. It didn’t take long to find what we were looking for.</p>
            <p>Tree branches arched over Goose Creek, creating a large, natural tunnel. It wasn’t particularly picturesque, and the water was deep and murky enough that I always got nervous when I felt something brush against my leg. It was a very typical Virginia creek; perfect for swimming.</p>
            <p>When we first found it, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was in the water. Surely, such an uninterrupted ecosystem would have plenty of time to be inhabited by some terrifying creature (or so my mind told me). Our part of the country was rife with folklore.</p>
            <p>Interrupting these thoughts, a carp emerged from the depths of the creek and poked its face out of the water. Its mouth opened and closed, opened and closed. Carp were not native to these waters, and I wondered how it found itself there. Was it happy in its new home? It was pulsating and slimy, begging for food. It seemed to call out. <em>Join us, join us</em>. It was no bigger than my forearm, but I couldn’t help but feel like it would swallow me whole if I went into the water. Its dumb eyes stared directly into mine, unmoving. I became acutely aware of the sweat accumulating on the top of my back, sticking to my shirt.</p>
            <p>A gentle voice rumbled in my heart. The wind blew her hair into my face.</p>
            <p>She grabbed my arm and we faced each other briefly. I looked back to the water and the carp was gone. The shadows cast by the leaves shook and made the water look like stained glass.</p>
            <p>I was the first to enter the water. I dipped a foot in, shivering, before plunging down. I resurfaced and swam into a patch of sun, warming my face as I floated. Ella was soon to follow, swimming clumsily to the other end of the bank where I was. Her tan skin and dark hair gave me the perception of an avid swimmer- like someone who grew up on an island. However, she looked uncoordinated and splashed loudly as she made her way over. It was an uncomfortable sight.</p><p>“Let’s follow the creek,” Ella said, rubbing the water out of her eyes.</p>
            <p>I nodded in compliance.</p>
            <p>We swam lazily, letting the slow current carry us. Through the web of leaves overhead, I watched the light peeking through and occasionally turned to look at Ella. She was more observant. Her eyes floated between branches, locking onto something new every few feet we traveled. It was hard to tell if she was gazing off or looking for something in particular. She rarely looked my way and stared blankly with her large eyes when she did. The corners of her lips were upturned. She looked through me, as if perceiving a beautiful sight in another world that I could not yet see.</p>
            <p>My stomach growled. We hadn’t eaten since lunch, and the sun was starting to set. In summer, the sun set late; it was well past dinner time. Hours had passed and I had no clue how far we swam. A pit of anxiety welled in me, wondering how far it was that we had actually gone. With no indication of measurable distance, I could only guess. My fingers were pale, spongy, and wrinkled. The water had carried us far. The carp was still somewhere in the water. Time to go home. I didn’t want to leave the water. I didn’t want to leave Ella. There was still so much more I wanted to learn about her.</p><p>I had a bad habit of trying to prescribe meaning to mundane, meaningless acts.</p>
            <p>For the rest of the summer, Ella and I abandoned the pool altogether in favor of Goose Creek. There were only a few weeks left of break before it was back to school, and they flew by incredibly quickly while we spent our days floating down the creek and chatting. August was summer’s Sunday. People tried cramming all their leisure activities in before the reality of classes and cold weather returned. I’m glad we spent the end of summer pursuing nothing new.</p>
            <p>Occasionally, we saw the odd fisherman here and there along the creek. Oftentimes, abandoned rods dangled from the wooden bridge which served as the entrance to the country club. I wondered why they came here when the surrounding area was filled with well stocked lakes, ponds, and rivers. After the carp, I never felt more than the odd minnow nibbling on the calluses of my feet. I don’t think those fishermen ever caught anything. They might have never left Goose Creek.</p>
            <p>Every one of those days was the same, but it was the most memorable time of my teenage years. My friends weren’t happy with my absence that summer, but when school started it was back to normal. I hung out with my friends and Ella with hers. We exchanged polite nods and smiles in the hallways and nothing further.</p>
            <p>It was our last summer in Virginia before we did what the rest of the town’s kids in our generation did; we left home. For college or work, it seemed that our generation collectively fled in a mass exodus from that sleepy hollow. After generations of our families staying in the valleys undisturbed, all the children emerged like cicadas, loudly proclaiming their plans to leave before seemingly vanishing. Very few were heard from again, and I find myself wondering more about those who might have failed in their pursuits than those who succeeded. None of us had discussed plans to skip town, and I don’t think we assumed any of us would. We all thought we were unique in that.</p>
            <p>Last I visited Goose Creek, years ago, but years after that summer, it was early autumn. The abandoned hills had been replaced by the beginnings of cookie cutter housing developments. I looked in the water and saw no signs of movement, no carp. A breeze, one of evening’s dying breaths, felt like the brush of a lover’s fingertips on my cheek. The tunnel of trees which once enclosed the creek was now thinning. Branches pushed close to each other but did not touch, instead swaying side to side in unison. The leaves were ready to jump. They looked like the torn pages of a children’s book. I could feel my heart beat through my ears. I opened my eyes and swear I saw something swim away downstream. It couldn’t have been any bigger than my forearm. The old wooden bridge that led to the creek was gone.</p>
            <p>When I close my eyes and try to remember the details of Goose Creek when I first discovered it with Ella, the memories are hazy. The harder I try to remember, the more it slips away from me. The less I think, the more I remember. It’s a careful balance not to forget things entirely.</p>
            <p>It was summer. There’s no mistaking it. Like in all memories, it’s always summer. For days at a time, we said almost nothing. Only in silence can you think of love.</p>
            <p>I can’t tell you if Goose Creek is still there, dried up, filled in, or reduced to toxic sludge. I haven’t been home since.</p>
