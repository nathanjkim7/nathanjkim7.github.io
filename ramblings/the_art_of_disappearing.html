            <p><i>The Art of Disappearing</i></p>
            <p>I will cease to exist entirely.</p>

            <p>The act is oversimplified to say that which was once me will stop being me. In fact, there never was “once me”. There will be nothing there, and never will have been. I would say there will be nothing here, but there never will have been “here”. Do you understand what I’m getting at?</p>

            <p>To be clear, it’s not that I wish I was never born. I’ve lived a good life and enjoyed quite thoroughly what luxuries have been afforded to me. I have friends, a family that is proud of me, and a well paying job. My childhood was picturesque, the kind of Americana that parents dream of providing to their children. I am profoundly grateful for the misadventures I’ve experienced. I will miss those feelings the most.</p>

            <p>The windows of my childhood room opened into thick woods. There were toads, rabbits, foxes, birds, squirrels, deer, and other woodland creatures that filled the gaps between the trees. I would often watch them from my bed. They breathed, moved, and ate in the way you’d expect a living thing to do, but moved aimlessly and stared at nothing. They seemed so unalive in ways that confused me deeply.</p>

            <p>When I was 11, it was there that I killed for the first time.</p>

            <p>I laid in bed looking out the window into the woods behind my room. The sun had set and the sky was a rapidly fading blue. The darkness did not stop in the woods. It penetrated my room and surrounded me. The woods swallowed me whole, and I could feel myself getting pulled out of my room into a green, leafy spiral. It twisted and tightened, and in the middle of the trees emerged a brown sparrow. It had dark eyes like small black river rocks. The way it stared frightened me. The sparrow was not just looking at me, it was perceiving all that I ever was and might become. Its head tilted back and forth, but its eyes remained trained on me. Nothing had ever understood me so deeply. I hated it for that.</p>

            <p>By my bed, I grabbed the .22 break barrel rifle I had gotten that Christmas and loaded it with a hollow point pellet. I propped the barrel through the open window, training the iron sights on that little bird. Everything around it faded, and the sparrow was all that remained in focus. I pulled the trigger and heard nothing. I saw no evidence of impact. In fact, I was unsure if I had even hit it. I saw no body nor any feathers. Where the small creature once existed was nothing but a tree, gently swaying with the fall breeze. Crickets chirped peacefully and a fox screamed from her den.</p>

            <p>Only when the sparrow vanished, when no trace of it remained, did I understand that it was never there. It did not disappear, the little bird had never existed at all.</p>
