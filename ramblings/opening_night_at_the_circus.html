            <p><i>Opening Night at the Circus</i></p>
                
                <p>My four
                years in university were marked by a series of acts and gags with the
                characters that filled my days. There was one friend, who I remember quite clearly
                now, to be a spectator to the circus. Riko lived directly across from me during
                our first year of university. We were in a co-ed dormitory, and the floor was
                lined with jesters, trapezists, conjoined twins, and other freaks. The first
                day at university was hot, muggy, and the crushing humidity in the air just
                made me want to take a long nap in front of an oscillating fan. Head to toe,
                head to toe, a breeze would rock me to sleep. We found no such refuge. The
                circus was in town, and furniture clogged the hallways. Hovering parents
                lingered by half open doorways, giving parting advice which would soon be
                forgotten by sage children that already knew better. Riko and I participated in
                the performance, as it was the right thing to do.</p>
                
                <p>I laid in
                my dorm bed without sheets. My moist back stuck to the plastic mattress, sweat
                pooling underneath me. I watched Riko unpack her things through our doors left
                wide open in a futile attempt to encourage airflow. She had a hunched posture
                and reminded me of how a stalk of scallion appears when left too long in a jar
                on the window sill. Watching her while I lay sideways with the whole world
                rotated 90 degrees, I imagined her to be an alien in an unnatural world. Riko’s
                eyes were sunken and large, and she would periodically pause to gaze at
                nothing. Nothing was just something I couldn’t see. She was deeply considering
                something orders of magnitude beyond my comprehension. She took a sharp inhale
                and held a bubble in her mouth shortly before returning to the mound of boxes
                in front of her. From the moment I noticed the focused look in Riko’s eyes, as
                if she was intermittently leaving our world to check on her own private
                reality, I felt a deep curiosity to see what secrets swirled in the seas of
                that parallel dimension. She did not yet know my name.</p>
